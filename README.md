# Park Ratings
This project attempts to predict the rating of users based on the text of their review. The data used was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dwiknrd/reviewuniversalstudio) and contains reviews of Universal Studio Parks. 
After basic cleaning two attempts are made. One using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, and the other using a dense neural network. The results would seem to indicate that a neural network is more effective for industry specific tasks.
